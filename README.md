HELL NAH NOW I GOT IT AAHAHAHAAHA


AAOT - Advanced OSINT Tool | No Fluff, Just Recon

A brutally efficient OSINT aggregation tool. Stop juggling a dozen different scripts and websites. AAOT pipes the power of crtsh, Maigret, Holehe, and others into a single terminal command. Get the data you need, in structured JSON, without the hassle.

The Gist:

    Targets: Domains, IPs, Email Addresses.

    Tools Included: The essentials. crtsh, maigret, holehe, wayback, whois, dig, ping.

    No Bullshit: Minimal setup. Free public sources. No mandatory API keys.

    Output: JSON. Parse it, feed it to another tool, do whatever.

For: Pentesters, researchers, and pros who value function over form.

ðŸš§ Brutal Feedback Welcome: This tool evolves based on user comments. Tell me what's broken, what's missing, and what sucks. See the changelog.


(just be open source and in the best os ever brutal.)
